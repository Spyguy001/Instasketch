### Functionalities

#### Student

- Sketchbook (sketchbook.html):

This is the first view a student can see when logged in. The sketchbook is the basis of our
application, where the student can do his/her sketches. The functionalities of our sketchbook
are to choose between 8 predefined colors, 4 different thickness for the brush, an eraser,
undo and redo function and clear the Sketchbook (all done in the javascript).

click on submit, which will prompt a confirmation to save the new drawing. The drawing is saved
as an SVG image.
